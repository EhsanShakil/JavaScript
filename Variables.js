//What is Variable?

// Varaibles in simple means just a name or some logical words you use to store something so 
// you can recall it or reuse it.

// Variable Syntax:
// var name = "Ehsan";

// To create a variable in Vanilla JavaScript we use "var" keyword.

// var skills;
// skills = "JavaScript"

// in the above example 

// var is a keyword through which we make variables.

// var skills means we just declare a variable with the name of "skills" 
// but we are not assigning any value into it. It means at that line value of 
// variable "skills" is "undefined".

// and in the next line we just assign a value with the keyword "=" and the value
// is "JavaScript"
